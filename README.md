# beatmap_classifier

This project was made possible thanks to HitomiChan_#1567 and his wonderfull beatmap skillset sheet.

I always hated pooling since hosting my first tournament and wanted to make it easier for poolers to find maps. I always wanted to make a project like this but sitting through maps and manually categorising them wasn't something I wanted to do. So, after seeing HitomiChan posting on tournament hub discord, I knew I had to do it.

For more info and testing for yourself, check out the google collab notebook I prepared.
