# beatmap_classifier

This project was made possible thanks to HitomiChan_#1567 and his wonderfull [beatmap skillset sheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y4asFlZlXvjw4G9GDZMs6xaPb5I7l6y34tT2CnAZNzM/edit?usp=sharing)

I always hated pooling since hosting my first tournament and wanted to make it easier for poolers to find maps. I always wanted to make a project like this but sitting through maps and manually categorising them wasn't something I wanted to do. So, after seeing HitomiChan posting his [beatmap skillset sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y4asFlZlXvjw4G9GDZMs6xaPb5I7l6y34tT2CnAZNzM/edit?usp=sharing) on tournament hub discord, I knew I had to do it.

For more info and testing for yourself, check out the google collab notebook I prepared.

Also, Thanks to [this repository](https://github.com/Awlexus/python-osu-parser) for providing beatmap parsing features. Without it, the work would be much harder. Tho I had to put it in my repository directly and share here because there were errors and I had to modify them.
